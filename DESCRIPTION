Description: The Ontario Marginalization Index is a socioeconomic model that is built on Statistics Canada census data.
    The model consists of four dimensions: Residential Instability, Material Deprivation, Dependency and Ethnic Concentration.
    Each of these dimensions are imported for a variety of geographic levels (DA, CD, etc.) for both the 2011 and 2016 administrations of the census (2021 pending).
    These data sets contribute to community analysis of equity with respect to Ontario's Anti-Racism Act.
    The Ontario Marginalization Index data is retrieved from the Public Health Ontario website: <https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/data-and-analysis/health-equity/ontario-marginalization-index>.
    The shapefile data is retrieved from the Statistics Canada website: <https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm>.
